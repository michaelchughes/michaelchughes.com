# Goals

This tutorial is intended for clinicians who wish to become familiar with recent advances in machine learning and how these might be applied to healthcare. Within machine learning, we will focus on methods for making predictions from multi-modal, time-varying signals. One motivating example will be the combination of vital sign data, diagnosis or procedural code data, text data, and image data available in a modern intensive care unit. We will sketch out major methodological approaches, discuss best practices in evaluation protocols, give examples of cutting-edge applications to the healthcare domain, and identify key limitations and remaining open problems.

We hope to give you tools to navigate successful collaborations with machine learning researchers, as well as the ability to critically evaluate claims about machine learning methods in the literature.
