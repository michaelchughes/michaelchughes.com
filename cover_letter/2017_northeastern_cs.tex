\makelettertitle

I am writing to apply for a tenure-track assistant professorship at Northeastern University. I believe my background in statistical machine learning and its applications to healthcare make me a good fit for the advertised position within the College of Computer and Information Science.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard SEAS, after completing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Brown in 2016.
My research develops machine learning methods
that discover actionable knowledge from large, messy datasets. 
My focus is healthcare applications, where new probabilistic models and optimization algorithms are needed to learn from abundant yet noisy and unlabeled electronic health records to produce insights clinicians can trust.
In one project, we modeled common vital sign trajectories in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) across 36,000 patients to predict the need for intubating with a mechanical ventilator. In ongoing work with psychiatrists at Massachusetts General Hospital, we are discovering subpopulations of major depression disorder that require distinct drug combination therapies. Our efforts build on the core contributions of my Ph.D. thesis: reliable algorithms for clustering hierarchical or sequential datasets which can scale up to cover millions of news articles or the whole human genome.
I strive to deliver results beyond top-tier publications, such as my open-source BNPy toolbox which is used by data scientists at the New York Times. As a future faculty member, I hope to build a group known for strong methodological contributions within machine learning as well as successful deployment of clinical decision support systems integrated at the point-of-care.

Looking forward, I am excited to join Northeastern to pursue this vision.
Within Northeastern CCIS, I see possible research collaborations with experts in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, probabilistic programming, and human-computer interaction to tame 
multimodal datasets from healthcare and beyond. 
I also envision personal health informatics collaborations with experts in the Bouv√© College of Health Science.
I value Northeastern's commitment on experiential learning, and I hope to help broaden its project-based courses, co-op offerings, and undergraduate research.
I have significant experience in STEM outreach (2 years as a Microsoft TEALS ``CS in Every High School'' instructor), and I plan to lead and mentor efforts to improve STEM diversity from K-12 to graduate school.
I am eager to join Northeastern to help realize the ``CS for Everyone'' vision. I look forward to hearing from you.
