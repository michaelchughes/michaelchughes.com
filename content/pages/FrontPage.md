Title: Hi, I'm Mike

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the computer science department at Brown University. My adviser is Erik Sudderth. I'm interested in machine learning and computer vision.

For my thesis project, I study large-scale unsupervised clustering problems like 
organizing every New York Times article from the last 20 years or 
automatically annotating videos of human activities.
My technical focus is on developing optimization algorithms for a broad family of Bayesian nonparametric models that include mixtures, topic models, sequential models, and relational models. My collaborators and I have released an open-source
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/michaelchughes/bnpy-dev/">
Python package called <strong>BNPy</strong></a>.
Please try it out!

      I visited several research groups at Northeastern, U. Washington, and MIT to
      discuss results from my thesis work trying to make 
      effective variational inference for clustering that scales to millions of examples.
