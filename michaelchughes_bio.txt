Michael C. Hughes ("Mike") is currently a postdoctoral fellow in computer science at Harvard University, where he develops new machine learning methods for healthcare applications with Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez. His current research focus is helping clinicians understand and treat complex diseases like depression by training statistical models from big, messy electronic health record datasets. Other research interests include Bayesian data analysis, optimization algorithms, and any machine learning applications that advance medicine and the sciences. He completed a Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University in May 2016, advised by Prof. Erik Sudderth. You can find his papers and code on the web at www.michaelchughes.com.
