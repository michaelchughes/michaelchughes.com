This repository contains all the source materials for my personal website. 

You can find a live version at www.michaelchughes.com.

Usage
-----
$ make html # Build source materials on local machine
$ make serve # Serve website locally. Point browser to localhost:8000
$ make rsync_upload # Upload only changed files via rsync

Dependencies
-----
* Pelican: http://blog.getpelican.com/
* Theme is pelican-bootstrap3: https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3 

Changelog
---------
* Changed Makefile so rsync_upload doesn't delete content from remote location (I keep lots of other things there.)
* Added a custom.css file under content/customstyles. This fixes some display issues for the navigation bar when including a site logo. Also makes fonts generally bigger.
