About
-----
This folder contains material to create the Curriculum Vitae (CV) for Michael C. Hughes.

I forked basic template material from the following MIT-licensed GitHub repos:
* [bamos/cv](https://github.com/bamos/cv)
* [emichael/resume](https://github.com/emichael/resume}

I have modified many things to suit my needs.

How to run
----------
Type `make` to generate a LaTeX pdf and a markdown file.  

Notes
-----
Most raw content in resume.yaml uses LaTeX commands for things like urls, etc. 
There is lots of code in generate.py to automagically do the right thing which building the markdown page.
