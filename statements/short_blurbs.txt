As a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, Mike is working on developing models and associated optimization methods for several healthcare applications. One project's goal is to develop time-series models for the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. The methods would take patient vital signs over time as input and provide output to help doctors predict when patients need costly interventions like intubation of a mechanical ventilator. This problem requires careful modeling of evolving physiological state and requires predictions to be interpretable to practicing physicians. This ongoing work will make progress on several key questions in applied statistical machine learning, such as how to balance prediction accuracy with interpretability and how to use vast amounts of unlabeled data to improve predictions on a label prediction task.
