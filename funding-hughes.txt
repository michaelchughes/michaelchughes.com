Dr. Hughes has been successful in securing external funding. In the past, he was Co-PI with Dr. Liping Liu on an NSF CISE grant (3 years, 9/1/19-8/31/22), with Dr. Matthias Scheutz on a DARPA SAIL-ON Program grant (3.5 years, 11/15/19-5/15/23), and on a grant from Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies with a team at Tufts Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health led by Dr. Peter Neumann (1 year, 1/1/21-12/31/21).

His current work includes two externally-funded projects. First, he is Co-PI on a US Army NSRDEC grant via Tufts CABCS (1 year contracts renewed successfully each year for 4 years in a row, 9/1/20-8/31/24) with Dr. Eric Miller. Second, he is Co-PI on a grant from the  Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (1.5 years, 9/1/23 - 2/28/25), with Dr. David Kent from Tufts Medical. 

This is a strong collaborative funding record, but Dr. Hughes has not had any grants as a solo primary PI.
